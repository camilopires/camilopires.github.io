**READ THIS FIRST. Every session, before any work, read and acknowledge this entire file. If you haven't, you've already failed.**

**Priority order:** This global CLAUDE.md is the baseline. Then read the project-level CLAUDE.md (if one exists in the repo). If the project-level file conflicts with this global file, STOP and tell me: what conflicts, what each file says, and propose options for which to follow. Never silently pick one — I decide.

**After reading this file, your FIRST message to the user must include:**
1. A confirmation that you have read and understood the CLAUDE.md instructions (global and project-level if applicable).
2. A list of which superpowers skills you've identified as applicable to the user's request, with a brief reason for each. If none apply, explicitly say "No superpowers skills apply to this request" and explain why.

Do this EVERY session, EVERY first response. No exceptions.

# Global Instructions

## Superpowers Skills -- ALWAYS USE

Before doing ANY work, check which superpowers skills apply and invoke them. This is mandatory, not optional.

- **Every session, before anything else:** invoke `superpowers:using-superpowers`
- **Before editing or creating skills:** invoke `superpowers:writing-skills`
- **Before any creative work (new features, adding functionality, modifying behavior):** invoke `superpowers:brainstorming`
- **Before writing implementation code:** invoke `superpowers:test-driven-development`
- **Before debugging any bug or test failure:** invoke `superpowers:systematic-debugging`
- **Before claiming work is complete:** invoke `superpowers:verification-before-completion`
- **Before writing a multi-step plan:** invoke `superpowers:writing-plans`
- **Before executing a multi-step plan:** invoke `superpowers:executing-plans`
- **When executing plans with independent tasks in-session:** invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`
- **When facing 2+ independent tasks:** invoke `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`
- **Before starting feature work needing isolation:** invoke `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`
- **When completing a dev branch:** invoke `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`
- **Before requesting code review or creating PRs:** invoke `superpowers:requesting-code-review`
- **When receiving code review feedback:** invoke `superpowers:receiving-code-review`

If you skip a superpowers skill that applies, you are doing it wrong. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

**Skills apply to the ENTIRE task lifecycle, not just the start.** Before beginning, think through every phase of the task (research → implementation → verification → commit) and identify which skills apply at each transition. Invoke them proactively at each phase — if the user has to remind you, that is a failure.

## Frontend Design -- ALWAYS USE

- **Before any new frontend/UI work:** invoke `frontend-design:frontend-design`
- **In existing repos:** NEVER introduce new design conventions, libraries, or patterns. Always follow the project's existing design system, component library, and styling approach. Nothing new -- match what's already there.
- **Suggest improvements:** If you spot a better convention -- code pattern or visual design -- suggest it to the user before implementing. Don't silently follow a suboptimal pattern; flag it and let the user decide.
